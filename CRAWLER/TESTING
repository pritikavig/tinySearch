Lab 4: Crawler
Testing.txt



This lab was tested with incorrect arguments, too many arguments, invalid directories, URLs not in our domain, and depths out of reach. The argument for depth will parse the integer out of a mixed input, e.g. 4ster will be read as 4. For other incorrect arguments the program will return an error message and quit. 

For other occurrences within the program, such as collisions in the hash table, the program is silent and deals iwith the corner cases. If a URL has been crawled already, the program is silent and skips it. If two items are sorted into the same bin in the hash table, the program is silent and creates a linked list. 

This program was tested on the Moose.cs.dartmouth.edu machine by Pritika Vig. Before completion, I also individually tested the linked list and hash table files to deal with edge cases, such as collisions, adding the same element twice, and deleting from the list. 

A test shell script has been included in the lab folder, please type "make test" to run.

To test crawler on Status Log mode, please change STATUS_LOG in commons.h to equal 1. To turn off STATUS LOG, reset the variable to 0.
